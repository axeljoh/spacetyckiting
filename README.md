# Space Tyckiting

Welcome to **Futurice Space Tyckiting**!

This repository contains the Space Tyckiting server and client skeletons.

Space Tyckiting server communicates via a *JSON-over-TCP* protocol, making it possible for the clients to be implemented in any language of your choice.

Ready-made client skeletons, which provide a convenient network communication layer, have been provided for a number of programming languages. You may also wish to create your very own client from scratch &mdash; no problem! Take a look at the example clients and documentation and code ahead! If you'd like to share your client skeleton, please issue a Pull Request.

If you discover any bugs or issues with the server or the provided client skeletons, please let us know, and if possible, issue a PR with a fix!

Please see the server [README](server/README.md), and the README's of the clients, for details on how to develop your AI and run Space Tyckiting.

Happy Space Tyckiting!
